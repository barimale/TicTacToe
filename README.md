# Description
TTT original logic is from here:
```
https://www.nuget.org/packages/TicTacToe
```
But, as it was a typo in the source code, 
an additional folder is added, which contains corrections.

TTT 4x4 is a kind of game, where only 4 fields may be selected.
Any time 5th field is being chosen, the first selection is cleared.
